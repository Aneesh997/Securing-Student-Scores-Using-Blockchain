Securing Student Scores Using Blockchain
Introduction
This project explores the application of blockchain technology in securing student scores and academic records. Blockchain, a decentralized digital ledger, offers an immutable, transparent, and secure way to manage sensitive student data. It eliminates the risk of data tampering, unauthorized access, and breaches by storing information in a decentralized manner. This system ensures that student data, such as academic scores and personal details, is protected and easily verifiable.

Problem Statement
Educational institutions manage vast amounts of sensitive data, including student scores, personal details, and academic records. Traditional methods of storing and managing this data are prone to security vulnerabilities, breaches, and manipulation. Blockchain technology offers a promising solution to these issues by providing a secure, transparent, and decentralized method to manage student data.

Key Features
Decentralized Security: Student data is not stored in a single location, reducing the risk of breaches.
Immutability: Once data is entered into the blockchain, it cannot be altered, providing a permanent and verifiable audit trail.
Transparency: Blockchain transactions can be traced, ensuring accountability and compliance with regulatory standards.
Smart Contracts: Smart contracts automate and enforce access controls, ensuring that only authorized personnel can view or update student data.
Advantages of Using Blockchain for Student Scores
Data Integrity: Immutable records prevent unauthorized modifications of student scores.
Privacy and Security: Cryptographic methods ensure that sensitive information is protected and accessible only to authorized personnel.
Trust and Transparency: Blockchain provides transparency and traceability, increasing trust among students and institutions.
Control: Students can have more control over their own academic records.
Dataset
The project includes a dataset of student scores, with the following columns:

id: Unique identifier for each student.
first_name: The first name of the student.
last_name: The last name of the student.
email: Email address of the student.
gender: Gender of the student.
absence_days: Number of days the student has been absent.
extracurricular_activities: Boolean indicating whether the student is involved in extracurricular activities.
career_aspiration: The student's career aspiration.
math_score: The student's score in math.
history_score: The student's score in history.
physics_score: The student's score in physics.
chemistry_score: The student's score in chemistry.
biology_score: The student's score in biology.
english_score: The student's score in English.
geography_score: The student's score in geography.
total_score: The total score obtained by the student across all subjects.
percentage: The percentage score calculated from the total score.
Disadvantages of Blockchain in Student Scores
Interoperability: Different educational institutions use different systems and formats, making data sharing challenging.
Information Asymmetry: Students do not typically control their own academic records, which conflicts with the decentralized nature of blockchain.
Scalability: Blockchain may struggle to handle large amounts of data efficiently.
Cost and Complexity: Implementing blockchain solutions can be costly and time-consuming, requiring major changes to existing systems.
Project Setup
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Install dependencies using your preferred package manager.
Import the dataset (student-scores.csv) into the system for processing.
Integrate blockchain functionality (e.g., Ethereum smart contracts) to handle student record transactions.
Usage
Blockchain Implementation: This project uses blockchain to store and manage student scores in a secure and immutable ledger. Only authorized personnel (teachers and administrators) can modify student records.
Smart Contracts: Smart contracts are used to automate data validation and enforce access permissions.
Future Improvements
Scalability Enhancements: Implement off-chain solutions to handle large datasets.
User Interface: Develop a user-friendly interface for students and educators to interact with the blockchain system.
Interoperability Solutions: Research ways to ensure smooth data exchange between different educational institutions.
